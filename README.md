# CAN API V3 for Kvaser CAN Interfaces

CAN API V3 is a wrapper specification to have a uniform CAN Interface API for various CAN interfaces from different vendors running under multiple operating systems.

## KvaserCAN-Wrapper

This repo contains the source code for a CAN API V3 compatible wrapper library under Windows for CAN Interfaces from Kvaser AB, Sweden.
The wrapper library is build upon the Kvaser CANlib SDK.

### CAN Interface API, Version 3

In case of doubt the source code:

```C++
/// \name   KvaserCAN API
/// \brief  CAN API V3 driver for Kvaser CAN interfaces
/// \note   See CCANAPI for a description of the overridden methods
/// \{
class CKvaserCAN : public CCANAPI {
public:
    // constructor / destructor
    CKvaserCAN();
    ~CKvaserCAN();

    // CCANAPI overrides
    static CANAPI_Return_t ProbeChannel(int32_t channel, CANAPI_OpMode_t opMode, const void *param, EChannelState &state);
    static CANAPI_Return_t ProbeChannel(int32_t channel, CANAPI_OpMode_t opMode, EChannelState &state);

    CANAPI_Return_t InitializeChannel(int32_t channel, can_mode_t opMode, const void *param = NULL);
    CANAPI_Return_t TeardownChannel();
    CANAPI_Return_t SignalChannel();

    CANAPI_Return_t StartController(CANAPI_Bitrate_t bitrate);
    CANAPI_Return_t ResetController();

    CANAPI_Return_t WriteMessage(CANAPI_Message_t message, uint16_t timeout = 0U);
    CANAPI_Return_t ReadMessage(CANAPI_Message_t &message, uint16_t timeout = CANREAD_INFINITE);

    CANAPI_Return_t GetStatus(CANAPI_Status_t &status);
    CANAPI_Return_t GetBusLoad(uint8_t &load);

    CANAPI_Return_t GetBitrate(CANAPI_Bitrate_t &bitrate);
    CANAPI_Return_t GetBusSpeed(CANAPI_BusSpeed_t &speed);

    CANAPI_Return_t GetProperty(uint16_t param, void *value, uint32_t nbyte);
    CANAPI_Return_t SetProperty(uint16_t param, const void *value, uint32_t nbyte);

    char *GetHardwareVersion();  // (for compatibility reasons)
    char *GetFirmwareVersion();  // (for compatibility reasons)
    static char *GetVersion();  // (for compatibility reasons)
};
/// \}
```
See header file `KvaserCAN.h` for a description of the provided methods.

## Build Targets

Important note: _To build any of the following build targets run the script_ `build_no.bat` _to generate a pseudo build number._
```
C:\Users\haumea>cd C:\Projects\CAN\Drivers\KvaserCAN
C:\Projects\CAN\Drivers\KvaserCAN>build_no.bat
```
Repeat this step after each `git commit`, `git pull`, `git clone`, etc.

To build all 32-bit targets (x86) run the script `build_86.bat`.
```
C:\Users\haumea>cd C:\Projects\CAN\Drivers\KvaserCAN
C:\Projects\CAN\Drivers\KvaserCAN>build_86.bat
```

To build all 64-bit targets (x64) run the script `build_86.bat`.
```
C:\Users\haumea>cd C:\Projects\CAN\Drivers\KvaserCAN
C:\Projects\CAN\Drivers\KvaserCAN>build_64.bat
```

#### uvKvaserCAN (DLL)

___uvKvaserCAN___ is a dynamic link library with a CAN API V3 compatible application programming interface for use in __C++__ applications.
See header file `KvaserCAN.h` for a description of all class members.

#### u3cankvl (DLL)

___u3cankvl___ is a dynamic link library with a CAN API V3 compatible application programming interface for use in __C__ applications.
See header file `can_api.h` for a description of all API functions.

#### can_moni (CLI)

`can_moni` is a command line tool to view incoming CAN messages.
I hate this messing around with binary masks for identifier filtering.
So I wrote this little program to have an exclude list for single identifiers or identifier ranges (see program option `/EXCLUDE` or just `/X`). Precede the list with a `~` and you get an include list.

Type `can_moni /?` to display all program options.

#### can_test (CLI)

`can_test` is a command line tool to test CAN communication.
Originally developed for electronic environmental tests on an embedded Linux system with SocketCAN, IÂ´m using it for many years as a traffic generator for CAN stress-tests.

Type `can_test /?` to display all program options.
